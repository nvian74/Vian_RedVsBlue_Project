# Vian_RedVsBlue_Project
As a Red Team security analyst I attacked a vulnerable VM within the environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
Next as a Blue Team analyst, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the time of my Red Team attack. 
I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for this report. 
Then, I interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.
